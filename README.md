# Crystal Ball Gtk

Gtk version of Crystal Ball for Linux

Since the Qt version is struggling to move forward (snaps are hard and/or I'm stupid) and elementaryOS requires that apps submitted to their app center be Gtk-native apps, here's a Gtk version.

You can check out the Qt version [here](https://github.com/Arc676/Crystal-Ball-Linux). If this Gtk version succeeds though, that project will be abandoned.
